networks:
  graylog:
    driver: bridge  # Configures the network to use the bridge driver

# This configuration sets up a basic but complete environment for Graylog along with its dependencies, MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
# All components are linked via a custom network, which improves security and communication efficiency between containers.
